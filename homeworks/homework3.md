## Homework #3 (Due: Nov 12, Mon 13:30)

Create a composition of the basic shapes you've learned until now: arc(), ellipse(), line(), point(), quad(), rect(), triangle(). The composition can be based on an abstraction of a picture you've recently taken or one of your favorite illustrations/drawings. Make some shapes change color/size/position according to the mouse position and mouse state (pressed/not pressed). Experiment with restrictions using map() function and distance calculation using dist().
