## Homework #3 (Due: Nov 12, Mon)

Create a composition of the basic shapes you've learned until now: arc(), ellipse(), line(), point(), quad(), rect(), triangle(), curve(), shapes: [beginShape(), endShape(), vertex()]. 

The composition can be an abstraction of a picture you've recently taken or one of your own favorite illustrations/drawings. 

Interaction+Motion: How would that static composition change in time? Make some shapes change color/size/position according to the mouse position and mouse state (pressed/not pressed), some shapes can be in constant motion autonomously - [remember the example](https://github.com/cerenkayalar/VCDS2105-ICM/blob/master/inclass/inclass4_eyes.pde) we did in last class. 

Experiment with restrictions using map() function and distance calculation using dist(). 

Make your code readable by adding comments, and define and use variables instead of hardcoded numbers around your sketch - reuse the variables if needed: some shapes' positions might change according to the other shapes' position. 

No code snippets from online resources for this homework, display what you've learned up to now. You are free to use text(). No functions, classes, advanced code snippets please 

Upload the sketch folder in a single .zip (max. 2 MB) to Google Drive folder /h3. Naming: **vcds2105f18_h3_YourNameSurname.zip** (Use English characters for your name and surname please)
