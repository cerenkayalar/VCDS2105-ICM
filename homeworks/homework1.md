# Homework #1

1. From the chapters you've read this week ('What Is Code?' and 'Form and Computers') of the book Form+Code, choose one 
visual artwork or design that utilizes instructions, algorithms, and/or software and create one 3 min presentation including
an explanatory visual of the piece, name, artist/designer, basic info and video link of the project. Upload it to Drive folder h1/presentations, naming: vcds2105f18_h1_YourNameSurname.pdf (max 2MB)

2. Create your self portrait using Processing ([some examples](https://www.openprocessing.org/browse/?q=self+portrait&time=anytime&type=all#)). This one will be a static sketch, you don't need to use setup() and draw().
Experiment with the 2D primitives of Processing. Upload the sketch folder in a single .zip (max. 2 MB) on Google Drive 
folder h1/processing, naming: vcds2105f18_h1_YourNameSurname.zip (Use English characters for your name and surname please) 
If the file is larger than 2MB, it will be deleted from the system.
