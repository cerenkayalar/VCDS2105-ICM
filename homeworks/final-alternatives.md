# Final Project Alternatives

If you got stuck on improving your homeworks to a final project, here are some more ideas for you to use:

p.1 Create a small visual world for the viewer to explore. As a point of departure, think about [Zork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUagi41Wo0) or [Howling Dogs](http://slimedaughter.com/games/twine/howlingdogs/), but with images in place of text. (Use your own images, either illustrations, diagrams, photographs, or collages.) The world is composed of three "rooms." The viewer can choose to navigate between these rooms with buttons that you create. The viewer can also explore and activate events in each room through rollovers and clicking on elements. 


p.2 Choreograph a set of visual patterns made with 'for' loops to a 30 second clip of music. First select the music and edit it down to 30 seconds if needed. Next, sketch and code the visual patterns. Finally, draw the patterns to the screen in relation to what is happening in the music.
You can form this project on the matrix of dots/lines inclass example.
