### DVD Screensaver

Remember the famous [DVD screensaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6mtmlX7Vrw) ([Recap from "The Office"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhxXCHhh9H8)) where the **DVD logo bounces around the screen** and 
we all waited desperately for it to hit the corner? Replicate that screensaver, but only using a **rectangle** instead of the DVD logo. 

The rectangle should start at a **random** location. 

Each time the rectangle **hits the edges**, it should **change its color (and obviously direction)**.

You won't need advanced functions for this homework, think in simple terms. Here is a list of functions, types, operators you will need to use more or less:

**data/primitive** int, float

**environment** width, height, size()

**structure** setup(), draw()

**color/setting** background(), fill()

**shape/2D primitives** rect()

**shape/attributes** rectMode()

**control/conditionals** if

**control/relational operators** < (less than), <= (less than or equal to), > (greater than), >= (greater than or equal to)

**math/operators** + (addition), += (add assign), - (minus), -= (subtract assign) * (multiply), *=(multiply assign)

**/random** random()

**output/text area** println()
