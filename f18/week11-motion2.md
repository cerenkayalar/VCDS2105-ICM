What are functions?

Can you define your own functions?

What do the return type, parameters passing. etc. mean?

## InClass Practice

MOVE FREEZE RELEASE

You should draw **4 circles** with **different colors**, starting from **4 corners** of the screen **traveling through the center** with 
**different speeds**. When you click and hold the mouse button, the balls should **freeze**. 
And when you let go of the mouse, the balls go back to their **initial position and keep moving**.

Don't use the [noLoop()](https://processing.org/reference/noLoop_.html) function, it interrupts the processing drawing loop, 
try to stop and start the movement using coordinates only

You may use [mouseReleased()](https://processing.org/reference/mouseReleased_.html) function or you may try different solutions. 
Be creative!

Bonus: try using [random()](https://processing.org/reference/random_.html) function to randomize the speed

Save as **p6_moveFreezeRelease.pde**
