# Homework #3: Move, Freeze, Release

## (Due: Oct 21, Mon 09:00)

Draw **4 circles** with **different colors**, starting from **4 corners** of the screen **traveling through the center** with **different speeds**.
When you click and hold the mouse button, the balls should **freeze**.
And when you let go of the mouse, the balls go back to their **initial position and keep moving**.

Don't use the noLoop() function, it interrupts the processing drawing loop, try to stop and start the movement
using coordinates only

You may use mouseReleased() function or you may try different solutions. Be creative!

Bonus: try using random() function to randomize the speed
