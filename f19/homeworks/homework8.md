# Homework #8: Hypnotizing Visuals

## Due: Dec 2, Mon 09:00

Choreograph hypnotizing full screen visuals (vivid colors, rich patterns) to a 30 second clip of a song:

Use Audacity to clip and edit the music file. Sketch your visual on paper based on the clip and code it in Processing. Draw the visuals in relation to what is happening in the music. A minimal way to complete this homework is to create **around 5 static, visual patterns and at different times within the 30 seconds of audio, hide and draw different patterns with 'if' structures**. A more ambitious way is to create a visual pattern that is animated, either based on the passage of time in the song, or based on the volume (amplitude) of the audio signal. Use the **PeakAmplitude** example of processing sound library (Processing Examples: Libraries/Sound/Analysis) to get the rms value (root mean square: don't be afraid, it's just a numeric value which you can use for various color and shape changes :), the change in the amplitude (volume) of the song, to modify some elements of your sketch.

Use **for loops** for repetition and **translate / rotate / scale functions** for variety in hypnotic visuals.

Upload the sketch folder in a single .zip (max. 5 MB) to Drive folder h8, naming: vcds2105f19_h8_YourNameSurname.zip (Use English characters for your name and surname please)
