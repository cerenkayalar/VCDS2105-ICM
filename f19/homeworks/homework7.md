# Homework #7: Back To Basics

## Due: Nov 25, Mon 09:00

Remember your last project in Basic Design Studio? You've mapped a song to design concepts and created related patterns. You will re-code your project using Processing:
 + Re-code your pattern design using 2D primitives
 + Define **at least one rectangular and one circular interactive area** using the circular and rectangular bounds examples that we are working on. You are free to choose **mouse over and/or mouse click** as the trigger of interaction. You can add keyboard interaction if necessary
 + Give your patterns **autonomous and mouse dependent movement**, try to make these movements **in sync with the song**!
 + Place the song name/link into the top comment section of your code
 + Take a picture/scan your pattern and upload it within the zip file

Upload the sketch folder in a single .zip (max. 2 MB) to Drive folder h7, naming: vcds2105f19_h7_YourNameSurname.zip (Use English characters for your name and surname please)
