# Homework #9: Composition

## Due: Dec 16, Mon 09:00

Load three images, at least one a PNG with transparency, and create a collage that changes its composition with mouseX and mouseY

Add at least two "hidden" interactive spots (circular or rectangular - you can use the **bounds** exercises we did before): one to display a short quote related to your collage and one to play a short related melody/effect (max 10 secs) when the mouse is over

Upload the sketch folder in a single .zip (max. 5 MB) to Drive folder h9, naming: vcds2105f19_h9_YourNameSurname.zip (Use English characters for your name and surname please)
