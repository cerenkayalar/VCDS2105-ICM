# Homework #6: Kid Pix

## Due: Nov 11, Mon 09:00

Write a drawing program in the tradition of [Kid Pix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TayProAkmBE&t=29s). Include, at the minimum, **at least two different tools** for making marks and two other features. Create an interface to **select which tool to draw with, by creating buttons (explained below) and/or by using the keyboard**. Have a clear point of view about drawing that is expressed through the design of your program. How is your drawing program unique and what is it for?

How to create buttons? (circular or rectangular interactive areas on the canvas). You can use the code provided in the book Getting Started with Processing: Drive/[resources]/[RF2010]bounds-of-a-circle-and-rectangle.pdf

Starting from this homework you are **not allowed** to use code found online! Use your own ideas and an empty sketch to improve your practice in creating interactive visuals using 2D primitives. Use only the concepts we've practiced in class.

Upload the sketch folder in a single .zip (max. 2 MB) to Drive folder h6, naming: vcds2105f19_h6_YourNameSurname.zip (Use English characters for your name and surname please)

## v2 // Due: Nov 18, Mon 09:00

Please improve your Homework #6 and upload as "version 2" (naming should have a suffix as v2) to the same folder until next week. Check the example I've uploaded ([week8_colorBuckets.pde](../inclass/week8_colorBuckets.pde)), it sums up what we've did in class yesterday regarding your questions. 

Remember: there is no right or wrong way to sketch in code as in every design process. Be creative and follow the hw brief, show progress at your best ')
