# Homework #4: Pattern Study

## Due: Nov 4, Mon 09:00

Take a picture of a tapestry rich in patterns (kilim, carpet, mandala  etc.. ) that you like (better if it belongs to you :)) and re-create it using Processing. Make it interactive and let it generate new possibilities of patterns, colors and textures.

Rules:
+ Understand and make use of [map()](https://processing.org/reference/map_.html) and [dist()](https://processing.org/reference/dist_.html) functions. (random() will be your friend to increase variety)
+ To make decisions, you need if / if-else blocks.

Your sketch should display
+ One element controlled by the mouse.
+ One element that changes over time, independently of the mouse.
+ One element that is different every time you run the sketch.

Upload the sketch folder (+the picture you've taken) in a single .zip (max. 2 MB) to Drive folder h5, naming: vcds2105f19_h5_YourNameSurname.zip (Use English characters for your name and surname please)
