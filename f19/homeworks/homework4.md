# Homework #4: DVD Screensaver

## Due: Oct 28, Mon 09:00


Remember the famous DVD screensaver ( [Recap from "The Office"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOtuX0jL85Y) ) where the **DVD logo bounces around the screen** and we all waited desperately for it to hit the corner? Replicate that screensaver, but only using a **rectangle** instead of the DVD logo. When you start the sketch, the rectangle should start at a **random** location. Each time the rectangle **hits the edges**, it should **change its color (and obviously direction)**.


Upload the sketch folder in a single .zip (max. 2 MB) to Drive folder h4, naming: vcds2105f19_h4_YourNameSurname.zip (Use English characters for your name and surname please)
