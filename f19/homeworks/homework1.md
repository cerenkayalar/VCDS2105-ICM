# Homework #1: Draw

## Due: Sep 30, Mon 9:00

Your first homework details are as follows:

1. From the chapters you've read this week ('What Is Code?' and 'Form and Computers') of the book Form+Code, choose one visual artwork or design that utilizes instructions, algorithms, and/or software and create one very short presentation including an explanatory visual of the piece, name, artist/designer, basic info and video link of the project (2-3 slides). Upload it to Drive folder h1/presentations, naming: vcds2105f19_h1_YourNameSurname.pdf (max 2MB)

2. Create your self-portrait using Processing ([some examples](https://www.openprocessing.org/browse/?q=self+portrait&time=anytime&type=all#)). This one will be a static sketch, you don't need to use setup() and draw(). Start by drawing your self-portait using your favorite Adobe tool considering your facial elements in 2D primitives. Experiment with the 2D primitives of Processing. Be creative! Canvas size: 400x400. Upload the sketch folder in a single .zip to Drive folder h1/processing, naming: vcds2105f19_h1_YourNameSurname.zip (Use English characters for your name and surname please) If the file is larger than 2MB, it will be deleted.
