# week14: Bubble Game

[week14_oop_v2](https://github.com/cerenkayalar/VCDS2105-ICM/blob/master/f19/inclass/week14_oop_v2/)


## Final Project

Use Homework 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 (+ don't forget the Bubble Game) as a prototype for your final project. Continue the work and ideas that you created for one of these projects. Expand the idea beyond the original one-week project into a project that can be completed for the final review. Work on a fullscreen canvas unless your project really requires a smaller canvas to provide a better experience.

Upload the sketch folder in a single .zip (max. 5 MB) to Drive folder **final**, naming: vcds2105f19_final_YourNameSurname.zip (Use English characters for your name and surname please)

p.s. Happy New Year! :)
