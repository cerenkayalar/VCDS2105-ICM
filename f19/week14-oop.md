## inclass Exercise / p9

Imagine and implement a compelling behavior for a simple, plain, 50-pixel-diameter white circle. What does it do? What does it like? Does it like to be touched? Does it enjoy spending time at the edges of the canvas? What does it hate? Is it afraid of the cursor?

Convert your code into an object-oriented program. Use the "constructor function" technique. All variables and functions related to the circle should not be global, they should all be encapsulated within the object.

Create a new character with more complex behavior and more specific visual features. Will you make an animal, an insect, a monster, a robot, or something less specific? Will it be drawn by hand, painting with pixels, or textured with photographs? After you further develop your creature, create at least two objects from your single constructor function and consider making many more by using an array.
