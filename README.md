# VCDS2105-ICM-Fall2018
Introduction To Digital Media Coding (a.k.a Introduction to Computational Media), Fall 2018 @Yasar University

This course is designed particularly for visual communication design students who are interested in better understanding how computers work, how their daily workflow can be improved using this knowledge and in learning to create their own digital media

## Description
Software influences all aspects of contemporary design and visual culture. Many established artists, designers, architects, creators of video games and animated films integrate software into their daily processes, write software to realize their ideas and enhance their work. This course will introduce coding using [Processing](https://processing.org) language, and explore programming concepts with the aim of using computation as an expressive and creative tool. At the end of the semester, the computer will not just be a tool, it will become a medium for the student. 

## Content
Students will learn basic programming skills, including understanding and controlling how data is represented in computers (data types and structures), telling the computer how to make decisions on the fly (conditionals) and how and when to repeat instructions (loops), structuring and organizing your computer code (functions and objects), and techniques for debugging your code. Using programming concepts as a tool, the students will generate images, create animations, manipulate text and make media respond interactively to user input. 
Processing, an artist-designed programming language will serve as the tool to create software ‘sketches’ that allows the student to express herself/himself visually and interactively. 
The course assumes basic high school math and no technical background.

## Outcomes
1.	Explore innovative ways in computational thinking
2.	Learn programming basics from variables to objects
3.	Understand and practice the fundamentals of interactive graphics
4.	Manipulate and generate media in image and text formats, in memory, in files and over networks
5.	Imagine, design and debug novel pieces of code
6.  Get acquainted with the Processing software environment

## Ethical Rules
Academic integrity: Students are required to use their own ideas and skills in order to produce original works. Any image, typeface, text downloaded from the internet, if not shared under a Creative Commons License, is considered
unauthorized. Therefore, any reproduction, representation, adaptation, translation and/or modification of someone
else’s work, partial or total, is prohibited. Students may consult with other students for conceptual and debugging help while working on their code, but unless specified on the assignment, the final code submitted should be written, tested and documented by the student. The case of using code snippets from online sources is allowed up to being 10% of the student’s submission with proper comments in the submission referring to the original source. Any student observed to not have adhered to these rules, will be subject to disciplinary action.
